# Employee-Tracker
This repo represents my submission for the module 12 challenge to make an employee tracker using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL

## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 12 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of an Employee Tracker command line application. Users can view, update, and create employees, roles, and departments within their institution. Employee views contain first names, last names, title, and manager ids. New employee information can be adds to the database, and it can also be updated. Role views contain the title of the role, its salary, and its department. New roles can be added to the database. Department views contain the names of the department and their database id. New departments can be added to the database.
